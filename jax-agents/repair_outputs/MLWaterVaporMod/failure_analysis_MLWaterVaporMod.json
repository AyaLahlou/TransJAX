  "error_summary": "All tests failed due to import error: 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named multilayer_canopy'. This is not a logic error in the translation but a Python packaging/module structure issue.",

    {
      "issue": "Missing Python package structure",
      "location": "Module import path: 'multilayer_canopy.MLWaterVaporMod'",
      "severity": "critical",
      "explanation": "The tests are trying to import from 'multilayer_canopy.MLWaterVaporMod' but this module doesn't exist in the Python path. The translated Python code was provided as a standalone file without proper package structure. The code needs to be placed in a proper Python package directory structure with __init__.py files, or the import paths in the tests need to be adjusted to match where the code actually exists."

    {
      "issue": "Incorrect module organization assumption",
      "location": "Test file imports at line 186, 210, 236, etc.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "explanation": "The test file assumes the translated code is organized as a package 'multilayer_canopy' with a module 'MLWaterVaporMod'. However, the provided Python code is just a standalone module file. There are three possible solutions: (1) Create the proper package structure with multilayer_canopy/__init__.py and multilayer_canopy/MLWaterVaporMod.py, (2) Adjust test imports to match actual file location, or (3) Install the code as a proper Python package."

    "Create proper Python package structure: Create a 'multilayer_canopy' directory with __init__.py and place MLWaterVaporMod.py inside it",
    "Ensure the package is in Python's sys.path or installed via pip install -e .",
    "Alternatively, update test imports to match the actual location of the translated code",
    "Add multilayer_canopy/__init__.py with appropriate exports: from .MLWaterVaporMod import *"

  "additional_notes": {
    "translation_quality": "The actual Fortran-to-Python translation appears correct based on code review. The polynomial coefficients, logic flow, and mathematical operations match the Fortran source.",
    "no_logic_errors_detected": "No semantic differences between Fortran and Python code were found. The translation preserves: (1) Polynomial coefficients exactly, (2) Temperature clamping logic, (3) Conditional branching for water vs ice, (4) Unit conversions (mb to Pa), (5) Latent heat selection logic.",
    "test_validity": "Once the import issue is resolved, the tests should run. The tests appear well-designed to verify correctness of the translation.",
    "immediate_action": "This is purely a Python packaging issue, not a translation error. Fix the module structure before re-running tests."
